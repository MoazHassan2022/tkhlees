It is a website for solving debt problems by making the creditor and the debtor post their case informations then working on solving these problems.
I developed it with DJANGO in python language and created its database with sqlite then converted it to postgresql for deploying.

It was for freelancing for a client.

I also contributed in its frontend with html, css and javascript.

I deployed this website on heroku.
